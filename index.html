    <h1>AKAN NAME GENERATOR</h1>
    <p>Akan names are derived from the Akan people of Ghana.</p>
    <p>
      The naming system involves naming their children after the day of the week
      they were born and the order in which they were born.
    </p>
    <p>
      These <strong>"day names"</strong>have further meanings concerning the
      soul and character of the person.
    </p>
    <p>The Akan naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa.</p>

    <p>
      Most Ghanians have atleast one name from this system even if they also
      have English or christian names. To read more on the Akan people and their

      Secretary-General <strong>Kofi Annan</strong>
